Instructions

ðŸ‘‰Keep in mind, If you're new to JavaScript, these problems will be hard! 

ðŸ‘‰Just try your best, and use Google if you need to 

ðŸ‘‰DO NOT watch the solution videos before trying the problems 

ðŸ‘‰Really, don't cheat. This is why there are no downloadable solutions

ðŸ‘‰Finally, if you want more practice, you can do 7 and 8 kyu problems here at here, at Codewars. 

Anything harder than these, or other practice sites like "Leetcode" are overkill for eCommerce developers, and not necessary.
